to	B-NARRATIVE
take	I-NARRATIVE

they	I-NARRATIVE
should	I-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
permitted	I-NARRATIVE

to	B-NARRATIVE
do	I-NARRATIVE
so	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

There	B-EXPOSITORY
are	I-EXPOSITORY
few	I-EXPOSITORY
sports	I-EXPOSITORY
that	I-EXPOSITORY
are	I-EXPOSITORY
safe	I-EXPOSITORY
,	I-EXPOSITORY

and	B-EXPOSITORY
no	I-EXPOSITORY
sport	I-EXPOSITORY
that	I-EXPOSITORY
is	I-EXPOSITORY
entirely	I-EXPOSITORY
safe	I-EXPOSITORY
seems	I-EXPOSITORY

to	B-EXPOSITORY
make	I-EXPOSITORY
any	I-EXPOSITORY
appeal	I-EXPOSITORY
to	I-EXPOSITORY
the	I-EXPOSITORY
people	I-EXPOSITORY
.	I-EXPOSITORY

Unlike	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
other	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
sports	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
there	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
is	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
no	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
enjoyment	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
this	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
one	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

those	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
who	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
take	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
it	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

As	B-NARRATIVE
has	I-NARRATIVE
been	I-NARRATIVE
said	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE

the	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
strain	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
on	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
them	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
is	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
terrific	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

Nor	B-NARRATIVE
do	I-NARRATIVE
we	I-NARRATIVE
believe	I-NARRATIVE

that	B-EXPOSITORY
people	I-EXPOSITORY
can	I-EXPOSITORY
become	I-EXPOSITORY
accustomed	I-EXPOSITORY
to	I-EXPOSITORY
such	I-EXPOSITORY
exhibitions	I-EXPOSITORY

without	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
themselves	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
being	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
somewhat	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
brutalized	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

So	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
it	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
seems	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
to	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
us	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

that	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
we	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
have	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
gone	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
too	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
far	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
this	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
form	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
of	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
sport	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

The	B-NARRATIVE
argument	I-NARRATIVE
has	I-NARRATIVE
been	I-NARRATIVE

that	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
these	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
races	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
are	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
necessary	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
for	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
development	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
of	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
automobiles	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

There	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
is	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
something	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
this	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
theory	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
,	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
perhaps	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
,	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

when	B-DESCRIPTIVE
the	I-DESCRIPTIVE
cars	I-DESCRIPTIVE
are	I-DESCRIPTIVE
stock	I-DESCRIPTIVE
cars	I-DESCRIPTIVE
.	I-DESCRIPTIVE

But	B-NARRATIVE
in	I-NARRATIVE
such	I-NARRATIVE
a	I-NARRATIVE
race	I-NARRATIVE
as	I-NARRATIVE
that	I-NARRATIVE
of	I-NARRATIVE
yesterday	I-NARRATIVE
nothing	I-NARRATIVE
is	I-NARRATIVE
proved	I-NARRATIVE

except	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
individual	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
car	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
wins	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
is	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
better	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
than	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
individual	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
cars	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
lose	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
,	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

or	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
it	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
has	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
a	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
better	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
driver	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

Some	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
weight	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
may	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
be	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
given	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
to	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
argument	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
tests	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
are	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
needed	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
for	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
development	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
of	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
product	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
,	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

but	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
tests	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
can	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
be	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
made	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
under	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
absolutely	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
safe	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
conditions	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

A	B-NARRATIVE
car	I-NARRATIVE
may	I-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
run	I-NARRATIVE
a	I-NARRATIVE
thousand	I-NARRATIVE
miles	I-NARRATIVE
and	I-NARRATIVE
at	I-NARRATIVE
top	I-NARRATIVE
speed	I-NARRATIVE

without	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
endangering	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
lives	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
of	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
dozens	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
of	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
other	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
participants	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
race	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
,	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

for	B-NARRATIVE
there	I-NARRATIVE
need	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
for	I-NARRATIVE
this	I-NARRATIVE
purpose	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
no	I-NARRATIVE
race	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

So	B-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
contest	I-NARRATIVE
must	I-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
considered	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
not	I-NARRATIVE
as	I-NARRATIVE
a	I-NARRATIVE
practical	I-NARRATIVE
commercial	I-NARRATIVE
test	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
but	I-NARRATIVE
as	I-NARRATIVE
a	I-NARRATIVE
sport	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

And	B-NARRATIVE
thus	I-NARRATIVE
considered	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE

we	B-NARRATIVE
feel	I-NARRATIVE

that	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
it	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
must	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
be	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
condemned	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
extreme	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
form	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
which	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
it	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
took	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
in	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
this	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
great	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
race	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

The	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
argument	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
is	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
strengthened	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
by	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
fact	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
everything	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
possible	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
was	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
done	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

to	B-NARRATIVE
make	I-NARRATIVE
things	I-NARRATIVE
safe	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

The	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
management	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
could	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
not	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
have	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
been	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
better	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

Every	B-NARRATIVE
possible	I-NARRATIVE
precaution	I-NARRATIVE
was	I-NARRATIVE
taken	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

No	B-NARRATIVE
expense	I-NARRATIVE
was	I-NARRATIVE
spared	I-NARRATIVE

to	B-NARRATIVE
promote	I-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
comfort	I-NARRATIVE
of	I-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
spectators	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

The	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
track	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
was	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
all	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
that	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
could	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
be	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
asked	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

In	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
every	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
detail	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
efficiency	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
of	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
management	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
was	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
shown	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

There	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
could	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
have	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
been	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
no	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
better	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
handling	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
of	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
the	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
affair	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
.	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

And	B-NARRATIVE
yet	I-NARRATIVE
in	I-NARRATIVE
spite	I-NARRATIVE
of	I-NARRATIVE
everything	I-NARRATIVE
one	I-NARRATIVE
man	I-NARRATIVE
was	I-NARRATIVE
killed	I-NARRATIVE

and	B-NARRATIVE
seven	I-NARRATIVE
were	I-NARRATIVE
injured	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

People	B-NARRATIVE
are	I-NARRATIVE
yet	I-NARRATIVE
wondering	I-NARRATIVE

how	B-NARRATIVE
it	I-NARRATIVE
was	I-NARRATIVE

that	B-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
other	I-NARRATIVE
accidents	I-NARRATIVE
did	I-NARRATIVE
not	I-NARRATIVE
result	I-NARRATIVE
in	I-NARRATIVE
many	I-NARRATIVE
deaths	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

We	B-NARRATIVE
shall	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
of	I-NARRATIVE
course	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
have	I-NARRATIVE
other	I-NARRATIVE
automobile	I-NARRATIVE
races	I-NARRATIVE
in	I-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
future	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

So	B-NARRATIVE
we	I-NARRATIVE
suggest	I-NARRATIVE

that	B-NARRATIVE
they	I-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
for	I-NARRATIVE
much	I-NARRATIVE
shorter	I-NARRATIVE
distances	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE
and	I-NARRATIVE
with	I-NARRATIVE
fewer	I-NARRATIVE
contestants	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

The	B-NARRATIVE
expert	I-NARRATIVE
will	I-NARRATIVE
take	I-NARRATIVE
note	I-NARRATIVE
of	I-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
fact	I-NARRATIVE
that	I-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
troubles	I-NARRATIVE
were	I-NARRATIVE
mostly	I-NARRATIVE
with	I-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
tires	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE

and	B-NARRATIVE
he	I-NARRATIVE
may	I-NARRATIVE
well	I-NARRATIVE
ask	I-NARRATIVE

whether	B-NARRATIVE
there	I-NARRATIVE
would	I-NARRATIVE
not	I-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
fewer	I-NARRATIVE
of	I-NARRATIVE
these	I-NARRATIVE
in	I-NARRATIVE
shorter	I-NARRATIVE
races	I-NARRATIVE
,	I-NARRATIVE

though	B-NARRATIVE
to	B-NARRATIVE
be	I-NARRATIVE
sure	I-NARRATIVE

the	I-NARRATIVE
killing	I-NARRATIVE
came	I-NARRATIVE
early	I-NARRATIVE
in	I-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE
contest	I-NARRATIVE
.	I-NARRATIVE

The	B-NARRATIVE
conclusion	I-NARRATIVE
is	I-NARRATIVE

that	B-ARGUMENTATIVE
these	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
races	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
are	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
not	I-ARGUMENTATIVE
necessary	I-ARGUMENTATIVE

to	B-NARRATIVE
test	I-NARRATIVE
the	I-NARRATIVE

they	I-NARRATIVE

be	I-NARRATIVE
thus	I-NARRATIVE
dealt	I-NARRATIVE
